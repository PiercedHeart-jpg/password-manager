# password-manager
this is a simple password manager i made in python :)
please do not use this as a real password manager i mean you can just do not recommend LOL
There is way better ones out there like keepass xc for offline use and also free and For cloud i recommend last pass not free i think
make sure to download the cryptography libary in terminal
this uses Fernet encryption from the cryptography library. Passwords are encrypted before being saved and can be decrypted only with the correct key.
